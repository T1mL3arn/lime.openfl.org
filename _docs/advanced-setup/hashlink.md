title: Setup HashLink
---

[HashLink](https://hashlink.haxe.org) is a cross-platform virtual machine for [Haxe](https://haxe.org/). It is often used by Lime and OpenFL developers as an alternative to compiling to native C++.

## Automatic Install

There is no automatic setup available for HashLink.

## Manual Install

There is generally no setup required for the HashLink target.

## Build & Run

To compile a HashLink application, run `lime build hl`. Add the `-debug` option to create a debug build. Add the `-release` option to create a release build.

To compile and launch a HashLink application with one command, run `lime test hl`.
