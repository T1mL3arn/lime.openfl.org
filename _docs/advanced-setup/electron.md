title: Setup Electron
---

[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org) allows developers to build cross-platform desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Lime and OpenFL may be configured to create an Electron app.

## Automatic Install

There is no automatic setup available for Electron.

## Manual Install

In order to build Lime applications using Electron, you must install Node.js and Electron.

[Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and run the installer.

Then, open a command-prompt or terminal and run the following command to install Electron globally:

```sh
npm install -g electron
```

## Build & Run

Run `lime test electron` to compile and run the Electron application.
