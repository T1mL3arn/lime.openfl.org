title: Setup HTML5
---

Lime and OpenFL may be used to create [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML5) applications and games for web browsers by [compiling to JavaScript](https://haxe.org/manual/target-javascript.html)

## Automatic Install

There is no automatic setup available for HTML5.

## Manual Install

There is generally no setup required for the HTML5 target.

## Build & Run

Run `lime test html5` to compile, start a local development server, and launch in a web browser.

## Using JavaScript libraries

To use an external JavaScript library with Lime, you need [Haxe externs](https://haxe.org/manual/lf-externs.html). See also [Haxe: Using external JavaScript libraries](https://haxe.org/manual/target-javascript-external-libraries.html).

Members of the Haxe community have already created open source externs for a number of popular JavaScript libraries, so be sure to search [Haxelib](https://lib.haxe.org/search) or [Github](https://github.com/search) to see if JS externs exist for your library before you try to create your own.
