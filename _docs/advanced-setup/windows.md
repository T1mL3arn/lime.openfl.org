title: Setup Windows
---

Create native [Windows](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/) desktop applications with Lime and OpenFL by [compiling to C++](https://haxe.org/manual/target-cpp-getting-started.html).

## Automatic Install

Open a command-prompt or terminal and run the following command:

    lime setup windows

## Manual Install

In order to build Neko applications for Windows, no further dependencies are required. However, in order to build C++ applications for Windows, you must have a compatible version of Visual Studio C++ installed on your system.

Currently, Lime requires a version of Visual Studio capable of targeting Win32. For newer versions of Visual Studio, this requires the "Windows Desktop" version of the software.

You can only target Windows from a Windows system right now. If you are interested in contributing to cross-desktop builds to Windows, please open a topic on the forums.

## Forums

If you encounter any problems when setting up Lime for targeting Windows, please visit the [forums](http://community.openfl.org/c/help).
